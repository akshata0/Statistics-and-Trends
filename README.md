ðŸ“Š GDP Analysis and Visualization Using Python ðŸš€
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, where I explored GDP trends from 1980 to 2028 using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to analyze economic growth across different countries.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates for accurate analysis.
âœ… Statistical insights: Descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, and GDP trends.
âœ… Visualizations:

Bar Chart: Top 5 countries by average GDP.
Line Graph: GDP trends for Luxembourg vs. Afghanistan.
Box Plot: GDP distribution across years.
This project provided real-world experience in data analysis, trend identification, and storytelling through data visualization.


Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! Feedback is always welcome.
